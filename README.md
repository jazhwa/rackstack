# rackstack

---

A parametric 3d-printable (mini) rack system.

- ***Not just STLs:*** Fully written in OpenSCAD. Everything, from the dimensions of the rack, to the roundness of the corners, can be modified with a simple code change.
- ***Printable from home:*** Designed to be printed with conventional FDM printers. Requires minimal supports when printing, and final assembly needs only a few easy-to-source parts. 
- ***No cage nuts!*** 
- ***Stackable:*** Individual racks can be easily stacked together. Mix and match different color and design combinations!
